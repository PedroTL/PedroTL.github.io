## About Me

---

I have almost two years of hands-on experience as a research assistant at the Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas Observatory and as a teaching assistant in econometrics coursework. I actively work on two prominent extension programs. The first focused on Productive Structure and Socioeconomic Development, conducting comprehensive studies on foreign trade within the Metropolitan Region of Campinas (MRC). The second, in collaboration with the FEAC foundation, involved conducting a Social Territory Diagnosis. This initiative entailed geocoding data obtained from the Unify Registry (Cadastro Único), a federal program that registers families in social vulnerability. Both projects offered valuable insights for the industrial and third sectors, as well as playing a crucial role in the decision-making processes within the public sector.

## Work Experience

---

**Research Assistant @ Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas Observatory (_March 2023 - Present_)**

- I worked on the design and methodology for geocoding over 70,000 families enrolled in the Federal Single Registry Program in Campinas using R, which efficiently selects the best coordinates based on unreliable addresses. This effort resulted in a better understanding of areas with social vulnerabilities through spatial visualization, offering valuable insights to policymakers and third-sector organizations.
- Designed and implemented a reproducible workflow in R and RMarkdown for use with the Single Registry data. The primary goal was to clean and prepare the data, which consists of over 170 variables, making it easier for other municipalities to conduct better geocoding and regional studies on social vulnerability.
- Collaborated with analysts from the FEAC Foundation to conduct a methodological study that encompasses the results and methods employed in the geocoding process of the Single Registry in Campinas.
- Maintained a consistent workflow with continuous commits, code reviews, and data wrangling to extract the insights requested by the leading researchers.

**Teaching Assistant @ Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas (_February 2023 - Present_)**

- Developed instructional YouTube tutorials to help students grasp course content and provided support with the R language.
- Design exercises, quizzes, and answer keys for students while being responsible for grading assignments.
- Conduct continuous online tutoring sections during the semester to assist students with course-related topics.

**Research Assistant @ Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas Observatory (_February 2022 - December 2022_)**

- Responsible for collecting, extracting, and validating data from international trade for the Metropolitan Region of Campinas in the R language.
- Developed an automated RMarkdown workflow for running monthly reports on the International Trade of the Metropolitan Region of Campinas (MRC), reducing the time required for releasing information to local media and public institutions.
- Conducted methodological studies involving statistical and economic analysis on topics with regional significance, aiming to provide better insights and understanding to policymakers, third-sector organizations, and the industry sector.
- Collaborated on data wrangling tasks, addressing specific requests from other research professors.

### The Geocoding Methodology Process for the Cadastro Único Families in Campinas-SP
[Publication](https://feac.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Geocodificacao_FEAC.pdf?portfolioCats=3105#new_tab)

Developed in collaboration with FEAC foundation analysts and researchers from the Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas Observatory, a unique methodology was established to geocode over 70,000 families registered in the Cadastro Único in Campinas. This process served as the initial phase to construct a social vulnerability index for the municipality. The outcomes revealed areas with a dense concentration of program registrations, offering valuable insights about social economic vulnerability for third-sector organizations and policymakers.

### Monthly Foreign Trade Report of the Metropolitan Region of Campinas (MRC)
[Publication](https://observatorio.puc-campinas.edu.br/informativo-mensal-balanca-comercial-da-regiao-metropolitana-de-campinas-volume-5-n-06-2022/)

Monthly Foreign Trade Report of the Metropolitan Region of Campinas (MRC), generated using an automated workflow in RMarkdown. This report contains vital data on exports and imports, including the trade balance, presented with both yearly and monthly comparisons. It elaborates on the complexity of exported and imported goods, making it a valuable tool for decision-makers in industrial and public sectors.

### [Workshop](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L3MPm8HDa4l9S6Ercza_izJzuLNSIsUG/view?usp=sharing): Geocoding and Cartography for Socioeconomic Studies

Instructors of the Academic Week workshop. The aim is to share the process of geocoding addresses and creating maps for various purposes using the R programming language.
