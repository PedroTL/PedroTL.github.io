## About Me

I have almost two years of hands-on experience as a research assistant at the Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas Observatory and as a teaching assistant in econometrics coursework. My first project focused on Productive Structure and Socioeconomic Development, conducting comprehensive studies on foreign trade and productive structure complexity within the Metropolitan Region of Campinas (MRC). The second, in collaboration with the FEAC foundation, involved conducting a Social Territory Diagnosis. This initiative entailed geocoding data obtained from the Single Registry (Cadastro Único), a federal program that registers families in social vulnerability. Both projects offered valuable insights for the industrial and third sectors, as well as playing a crucial role in the decision-making processes within the public sector.

## Education

- Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas (_December 2023_)
- [Thesis](https://pedrotl.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2/): DETERMINANTS OF CRIME IN BRAZILIAN SOUTHEAST: APPLICATION OF SPATIAL ECONOMETRIC TECHNIQUES

## Work Experience

**Research Assistant @ Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas Observatory (_March 2023 - Present_)**


- I was involved in developing the methodology to Geocode over 70,000 families enrolled in the Federal Program of the Unique Registry in Campinas. My responsibility included analyzing sensitive data comprising more than 170 variables using R. This initiative significantly enhanced our comprehension of areas with social vulnerabilities through spatial visualization, yielding valuable insights for policymakers and third-sector organizations.
- I devised and implemented a replicable workflow in R specifically tailored for the Unique Registry data. This involved creating an R package ([RefineGeo](https://github.com/PedroTL/RefineGeo)) that streamlined the geocoding process used within the study. The primary objective was to cleanse and prepare the data, simplifying the process for other researchers to conduct more effective geocoding, particularly in regional studies focusing on social vulnerability.
- Collaboratively, I worked alongside analysts at the FEAC Foundation to conduct a comprehensive methodological study covering the outcomes and techniques employed in the geocoding process of the Unique Registry in Campinas.
- Consistently, I managed workflow activities encompassing commits, code reviews, and data manipulation to extract pertinent insights as requested by the lead researcher.


**Teaching Assistant @ Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas (_February 2023 - Present_)**

- Developed instructional YouTube tutorials to help students grasp course content and provided support with the R language.
- Design exercises, quizzes, and answer keys for students while being responsible for grading assignments.
- Conduct continuous online tutoring sections during the semester to assist students with course-related topics.

**Research Assistant @ Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas Observatory (_February 2022 - December 2022_)**

- Responsible for collecting, extracting, and validating data from international trade for the Metropolitan Region of Campinas in the R language.
- Developed an automated RMarkdown workflow for running monthly reports on the International Trade of the Metropolitan Region of Campinas (MRC), reducing the time required for releasing information to local media and public institutions.
- Conducted methodological studies involving statistical and economic analysis on topics with regional significance, aiming to provide better insights and understanding to policymakers, third-sector organizations, and the industry sector.
- Collaborated on data wrangling tasks, addressing specific requests from other research professors. 

## Projects

### The Geocoding Methodology Process for the Cadastro Único Families in Campinas-SP
[Full Study](https://feac.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Geocodificacao_FEAC.pdf?portfolioCats=3105#new_tab)<br>
[Portifolio Publication](https://pedrotl.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/)

Developed in collaboration with FEAC foundation analysts and researchers from the Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas Observatory, a unique methodology was established to geocode over 70,000 families registered in the Cadastro Único in Campinas. This process served as the initial phase to construct a social vulnerability index for the municipality. The outcomes revealed areas with a dense concentration of program registrations, offering valuable insights about social economic vulnerability for third-sector organizations and policymakers.

[Portifolio Publication](https://pedrotl.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-3/)

Monthly Foreign Trade Report of the Metropolitan Region of Campinas (MRC), generated using an automated workflow in RMarkdown. This report contains vital data on exports and imports, including the trade balance, presented with both yearly and monthly comparisons. It elaborates on the complexity of exported and imported goods, making it a valuable tool for decision-makers in industrial and public sectors.

### Instructor of the Academic Week workshop. 
[Certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L3MPm8HDa4l9S6Ercza_izJzuLNSIsUG/view?usp=sharing)

The aim is to share the process of geocoding addresses and map making for various purposes using the R programming language.

### R Package RefineGeo
[GitHub](https://github.com/PedroTL/RefineGeo)

The RefineGeo package offers a comprehensive suite of functions aimed at refining address data, extracting meaningful location information, and enabling advanced Geocoding comparisons. 

### Unveiling Commodity Futures’ Closing Prices: PCA Analysis Using Plotly
