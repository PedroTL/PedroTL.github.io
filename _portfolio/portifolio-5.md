## Overview of the Project

I am thrilled to present my latest project, "Unveiling Commodity Futures’ Closing Prices: PCA Analysis Using Plotly". In this analysis, I explore the intricate world of commodity futures trading and market relationships, shedding light on the underlying dynamics and correlations among different commodities.

The global derivatives marketplace offers a plethora of opportunities, and understanding market trends and risks is crucial for informed decision-making. This project dives into the analysis of future closing prices across a carefully selected group of commodities. It aims to provide valuable insights into the interconnectedness of these commodities, aiding in risk management and offering a clearer comprehension of market trends.

The analysis is divided into two insightful sections. The initial part involves an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) utilizing Multivariate Analysis techniques, particularly focusing on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This method allows for the discovery of inherent patterns and correlations among numerous variables, providing a comprehensive view of the market relationships.

The subsequent section delves deeper into the relationships uncovered in the PCA analysis, offering interpretations and insights into five prominent categories identified as pertinent in the analysis.

I invite you to explore the full analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics behind commodity futures’ closing prices. [Read the full report here](https://rpubs.com/PedroT/commodity-futures-closing-prices-pca-plotly).

I hope you find this analysis insightful and informative. Stay tuned for more projects and analyses coming soon!
