## Overview

I am excited to introduce the RefineGeo package, a powerful tool designed to streamline Geocoding processes and enhance location data analysis within R. Geocoding, the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates, is fundamental in various domains, from spatial analytics to business intelligence.

The RefineGeo package offers a comprehensive suite of functions aimed at refining address data, extracting meaningful location information, and enabling advanced Geocoding comparisons. Developed within the R environment, this package empowers users to effectively handle and analyze address data for precise location-based insights.

## Key Features

- **Address Cleaning:** With the `clean_address` function, the package cleans address strings, removes punctuations, accents, and duplicates, standardizing the format for consistent analysis.
- **CEP Extraction:** The `extr_cep` function extracts CEP (Brazilian Zip Code) patterns from address strings, offering options to consider both 5 and 8-digit CEPs.
- **CEP Comparison:** Utilize the `compare_cep` function to compare CEPs extracted from different addresses, facilitating CEP equality checks between strings.
- **Spatial Analysis:** The `points_out` function enables checking if coordinates fall within or outside a specified municipal boundary, aiding in spatial analysis.
- **Geocoding Analysis:** Employ the `get_best_coords` function to perform Geocoding comparisons across multiple services, facilitating the selection of the most accurate coordinates.

This package is designed to ease the complexities of Geocoding processes and enhance the quality and accuracy of location-based analyses.
