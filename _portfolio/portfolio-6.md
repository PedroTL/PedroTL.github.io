## Overview

The Health Prices Bank (BPS), established in 1998, is a crucial measure by the federal government to consolidate and disseminate data on the acquisition of medical and hospital supplies, both in the public and private spheres. To simplify the comparison of medication values, the BPS aims to ensure efficiency in the use of public resources, providing managers and technicians of the Unified Health System (SUS) with access to essential information for formulating strategies and informed decisions.

This project aims to carry out an analysis of purchases of medical and hospital supplies registered with the BPS during the year 2022. The exploratory analysis will cover several topics to provide a comprehensive understanding of the panorama of transactions in the healthcare sector.
